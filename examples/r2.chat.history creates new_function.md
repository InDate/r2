Why did the computer get tired? Because it had a hard drive!

#### I have this appearing in a .md file "> Total running cost: $0.002". I would like a function that can open the md file and find the last occurance of this, then extract just the number. Add this function to the utils file  
> Prompt Tokens: 1392  
> Total running cost: $0.053  

To implement this function, I will modify the `r2/utils.py` file. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Import the `re` module for regular expressions.
2. Create a new function called `extract_last_running_cost` that takes a file path as an argument.
3. Open the file and read its content.
4. Use a regular expression to find all occurrences of the pattern "> Total running cost: $[number]".
5. Extract the last occurrence and return the number as a float.

Here's the code change for `r2/utils.py`:

```python
r2/utils.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
=======
import re

def extract_last_running_cost(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
    pattern = r'> Total running cost: \$([\d.]+)'
    matches = re.findall(pattern, content)
    if matches:
        return float(matches[-1])
    return None
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

This new function `extract_last_running_cost` can be used to extract the last running cost from a given markdown file.
